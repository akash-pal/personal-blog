### Contributing to The Arctic Code Vault

With the motive of preserving the code for future generations, GitHub, along with other known foundations, has initiated the ‘Arctic Code Vault’ [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/)

**Why the Arctic?**

There is similar storage for all the seeds stored in the world known as the ‘Svalbard Seed Vault or Global Seed Vault’ [Svalbard Global Seed Vault — Crop Trust](https://www.croptrust.org/our-work/svalbard-global-seed-vault/) .

This is the objective of the Seed Vault:

> It is a long-term seed storage facility, built to stand the test of time — and the challenge of natural or man-made disasters. The Seed Vault represents the world’s largest collection of crop diversity.

**Why is the preservation of code necessary?**

All the current storage options available ranging from hard drives, SSDs, CDs are only robust enough to last for a few decades. So to extend this preservation beyond this limitation to a lifespan of over 1000 years the data will instead be stored on 3,500-foot silver halide film reels.

**When was the first storage done?**

On 02/02/2020, which included all the active public and dormant GitHub repositories.

What were the criteria considered for a repository to be archived?

1.  Every repository with any commits between 13/11/2019–02/02/2020 (previous 80 days)
2.  Every repository with at least 1 star and any commits between 02/03/2019–02/02/2020 (previous 365 days)
3.  Every repository with at least 250 stars.

**What did it include from each repository?**

*   HEAD of the default branch of each repository
*   Excluding any binaries larger than 100KB.
*   Each Repository is compressed as single TAR file.

**How do you know if you have contributed to the Arctic Code Vault?**

On The desktop GitHub website, the ‘Arctic Code Vault Contributor’ badge will be included under the Highlights section:
